# Chatterfly
## Like Shutterfly but not

1. `npm i`
2. You'll need two terminal panes open, run these commands in each terminal pane:
  - `npm run-api-server`
  - `npm start`
3. Open a browser and go to `localhost:1234`

## Features
As a user I can:
  - Sign in
  - See how long I've been signed in
  - See a list of chat rooms
  - See a list of users in a chat room
  - See a list of messages
  - Send messages

You can also open the app in a new tab, sign in as a different user,
and see messages from the instance of the app running in the first tab.

The view will automatically scroll to the bottom when new messages are sent

There is also a very crude "like" feature where you can click on a message
and watch the number of "likes" increment
